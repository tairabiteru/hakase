# Hakase
Hakase is a general purpose Discord bot designed for the [Guild of Library Makers](https://www.guildoflibrarymakers.com/). Like many of my bots, she is based on a framework developed for my personal bot, Farore.


## What's she made of?
Hakase makes use of the following technologies:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.12
- [Hikari](https://www.hikari-py.dev/)
- [Lightbulb](https://hikari-lightbulb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
- [Miru](https://hikari-miru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)

## FAQ

- **Does this use AI?** - Nope, she's a 100% organic, free range Discord bot, written by hand by someone who's been smacking his head against his desk for the last 10 years, also known as "coding."

- **Can this run on Windows?** - No. Linux only.

- **Why not?** - ~~Because Microsoft smells :^)~~ Because the framework Hakase runs on is built upon Linux specific technologies, Systemd and bash to name examples. My server runs Linux and will probably only ever run Linux, so there's no reason for me to support other environments. 

- **Can you add `$some_new_feature`?** - Maybe if I like it. Ask me.

- **Why is she named Hakase?** - 'Hakase' is the Japanese word for an expert, or a 'learned person.' A professor. Her namesake is [Hakase Shinonome](https://nichijou.fandom.com/wiki/Hakase_Shinonome), a character in the manga [Nichijou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichijou).
